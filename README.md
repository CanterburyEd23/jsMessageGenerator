### Introduction

This is a random message generating program, built as my first portfolio piece whilst completeing the Full Stack Engineer course on Codecademy.  Upon running the program, it will "create" a new beer with a random name, from a random brewery, and containing a random selection of hops in the ingredient list.

### Technology

This program will be written in JavaScript in the Visual Studio Code environment.  It will be version checked with Git, and launched on GitHub.  Arrays will be used to store all of the random possibilities of brewery name, beer name, and hop varieties.  A function will be written that combines a random selection from each array into a message, styled as a message anouncing the launch of a new beer.

###Launch

On launching the program, the user will be presented with a random message, generated on launch.  To run the program again, it will need to be closed and re-booted.
