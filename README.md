### Code Description

The code running this program is pretty basic.  It consists of one object, "randomMessage", containing three arrays with the possible random bits of information in, methods to select a random index from each array, and the message generating method that will return a random message.

### Launch

To run this program, execute the following command in the terminal.  "node messageScript.js"

### Purpose

This program is intended as a portfolio piece, the first portfolio piece created as part of the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer course.  Whilst the code itself is quite simple, this exercise was intended more to enable me to become comfortable working in my own development environment, and to become familiar with using git version control, and GitHub.
